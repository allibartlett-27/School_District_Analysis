# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this anaylsis was to help Maria and her supervisor remove testing scores from the 9th grade class at Thomas High School because there was reason to expect those grades have been tampered with. We needed to remove those altered scores and then recreate the school district analysis showing a summar of scores per each school, the top 5 schools and the bottom 5 school based on passing scores. It also included the average math, reading and overall scores by grade, and how these scores correlate by school spending, the scores by school size and school type. 

## Results 
**- How is the district summary affected?** 

The district summary does not seem to be overly affected by the elimination of the 9th grade class at Thomas High School. In total there were 461 students removed. The averages for the district stayed almost exactly the same. 
In the images here, you can see that the numbers have slight changed for each percentage but when we format and round our data, the numbers appear to be the same.

[District Summary without Thomas High School 9th Grade](https://github.com/allibartlett-27/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Disctrict%20Summary%20New.PNG)
This means removing the 9th grade class from Thomas didn't have that much impact on the overall district results. 

**- How is the school summary affected?**

The main difference I see in the school summary is the percentages of students passing each subject dropped but Thomas High School is still among the top 5 performing schools. 

**- How does replacing the 9th grader's math and reading scores affect the performance of Thomas High School relative to the other schools?**

By replacing the 9th graders score, I am showing this has little affect on how Thomas High School performed in camparison to the other schools. They were still among the top performing schools. 

**- How does replacing the ninth-frade scores affect the following:**
  
   *- Math and reading scores by grade*
  
  When we look at the Math and Reading scores for each school by grade we can see that the scores for Thomas High School 9th grade are both nan. Since we replaces all of the scores with nan, we no longer have data to report in this field. 
  
   *- Scores by school spending, school size and school type*
  
  I did not see any major differences in these fields. 
  
## Summary

Based on what I am showing between the scores that include the 9th grader's from Thomas High School and the scores that do not, it appears to me that the data was a small enough number that it did not make the much of an impact on the impact. We can also conluce that the scores that were reported for the 9th grade class at Thomas High School may not have been passing, therefore when we run the pssing scores by school and district, the numbers are not affected tremendously. We can see that both 9th grade reading scores and 9th grade math scores are in fact nan, but the percentages of passing grades on a larger scale was not affected. I would say that the 9th grade scores follow the same pattern of as the entire Thomas High School student body because Thomas High School was still one of the top performing skills.
